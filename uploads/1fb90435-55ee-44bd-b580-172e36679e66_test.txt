Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data.
Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers for complex tasks.
Natural Language Processing helps computers understand human language.

Python is the most popular programming language for AI development because of 
its simplicity and powerful libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Applications of AI include healthcare diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, 
recommendation systems, and chatbots.
